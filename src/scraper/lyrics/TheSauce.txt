[Eminem talkin']
Its all bad now man, its all bad 
But yal done fucked up now 
Yeah ha ha, new shit, hey yo 
I just want the whole world to know: 
That I did not start this, but I will finish it 

[Verse]
Comin up it never mattered was color you was 
If you could spit then you could spit, thats it, thats what it was 
Back when, motherf*ckers was straight back packin 
Cypherin, fightin for life in this rap 
for the mic to get past and you psyched and you gasped 
and you hyped cuz you last and you might whoop some ass 
If you lost then you lost shake hands like a man 
and you swallowed it, when the unsigned hype column 
at The Source was like, the only source of light 
When the mics used to mean somethin, a four was like 
you were the ****, now its like the least you get 
three and a half now just means you a peice of **** 
four and a half or five, means you Biggie, Jigga, Nas, 
or Benzino I dont think you even realize 
you playin with motherf*ckers lives, I dont watched Dre 
get ****ed on The Chronic, probably cuz I was on it 
Now you f*cked me outa my mics twice I let it slide 
I said I wouldnt hold my f*cken breathto get a five 
Sh*t I was right, Ida f*ckin died already tryin 
I swear to God I never lie I bet thats why 
you let that b*tch give me that bullsh*t review 
I sat and took it, I aint look at the sh*t we knew 
You'd probly try to f*ck us with Obie and 50 too 
F*ck a relationship we through 
No more Source with street cred, them days is dead 
Dre's got A-Ks to dave mase's head 
Every issue there's an eight page Made-Mens spread 
Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head 
That I am not afraid, hes just a f*ckin waste of lead 
on my pencil, for me to write some sh*t this simple 
So listen closely, as I break it down and proceed 
This old Gs bout to get smoked like raw weed 
You dont know me or my motherf*ckin mother you motherf*ckin punk 
Put me on your motherf*ckin cover to sell your little sell out mag 
I aint mad I feel bad, heres an ad, heres a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad 
You wanna talk about some sh*t that you dont know about ya 
Lets talk about how your puttin you own son out there 
To try to eat off him, cuz you missed your boat 
Your never gonna float b*tch your just too old 
No wonder your sore now  your bored now 
Im pushin thirty your kickin fourty's door down 
B*tch this is war now, and youl never beat me 
all you do is cheat me out of quatables but you know 
that youl always see me on your TV 
Cuz you gotta stay up till three in the mornin 
To see your video played once on BET 
So he-he-he who gets the last laugh 
Aftermath ya so on behalf on our whole staff 
kiss our ass-hole cracks we'll never fold or hold back 
Just know that Benzinos wack 
no matter how many times I say his name, hell never blow jack 
Your better off tryin to bring R-S-O back 
Look at your track record thats how far it goes back 
Its extortion  proportion 
so half of the staff up there is fresh outa jail from boston 
Bullyin and bossin, caged like a slave they've completely brainwashed him 
And forced him to stay locked in his own office afraid of the softest 
fakest, wannabe gangster in New York 
And its pitiful, cuz I never woulda said sh*t to you if you'd kept your mouth shut 
B*tch now what get a clue, spit it slay 
New sh*t, exclusive  whoo kid
You know what to do with this: use it 
Im through, this is stupid, I cant believe I stooped to this 
bullsh*t to do this... 

And who you callin a b*tch B*tch. You owe me.
