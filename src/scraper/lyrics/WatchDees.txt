(Thirstin Howl): 
I hit harder 
Than Forman 
Landing both both gloves to a low blow 
With no cup 
Leave you Speech-less like when Arrested Development broke up 
Carry a crow bar for egos that won't budge 
Crack skulls 
Through helmets 
With the penetration of a screw nailed in 
Return like I was sending self addressed postage 
Throw bricks the size of the Stonehenge 
Before battles, we pour blood 
And toast, death to wicked infants 
Found on the sorceress' doorsteps 
Slaughter lamb 
And boar's head 
Every MC's cause of boredness 
And mind bondage 
Bronchitis, lung failure 
Language unfam-i-liar 
Art through a flooded air brush 
??? leave craft 
Sentences joined with words holding hands 
It's a tight squeeze 
From where your head will be landing 
In exact time flight leaves 
 
Watch this 
Watch this 
Watch this 
Don't watch that, watch this 
 
(Eminem): 
Who's arm is this? 
I must have cut it off at the pharmacist 
And refused to resume my severed prescription of ??? 
I'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets 
And never leaves his house 'cause he thinks his car's possessed 
I hate my life 
That's why I degrade my wife 
Grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich 
And just ate the knife 
My mother's screaming 'please heal him, take him straight to Christ' 
Meet you on the street and slap you just to break the ice 
Made a bomb threat with a fake device 
Strip you naked twice, pistol whip you and force you to take advice 
And if you catch me bobbin' my head to some bullshit spittin' 
I was probably just tryin to shake the lice 
Bugs fallin' out of my head 
I'm wishin' I was dead 
While I'm crawlin out of my bed 
Found it red 
And my rash is returning 
I feel the sensation of burning 
Occurring, usually during pain for release in my urine 
Screamin' at my shadow 'please quit followin' me' 
These pills keep screamin' 'please quit swollin' me' 
The devil keeps screamin' 'please get down on one knee' 
Took the drugs before the cops ever found them on me
