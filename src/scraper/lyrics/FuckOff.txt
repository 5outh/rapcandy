A shimmy shimmy go go motha fuckin pop 
It's the K-K-Kid Rock with the K-K-Kid Rock shit 
I'm on top bitch and rock for tricks 
Hella whips and nips and flip trips for whips 
I get all the money pussy falls like rain 
Been gettin' laid and paid that's why I never complain 
If I ain't in it for the money I'm in it for the P (or is it D) 
It's 1998 yo and you still can't fuck with me 
You don't be fuckin' with the blue eye 
Fuckin' with my 2-5 up your fuckin' ass like my shoe size 
I got a new vibe, kinda like Voodoo 
You do what we say and we'll do what we want to 
We're fuckin' up your city and we're fuckin' up your progam 
Fuckin' all your bitches we can fuckin' give a goddamn 
Twisted Brown gets down with no assistance 
We won't quit until we're banned from existence 
Persistance pays if that holds true 
Then I'm gonna buy this fuckin' planet before the time I'm through 
I was praised and raised on the thoughts of no takings 
So let me get what I got comin' and the rest I'm fakin' 
I'm shakin' like Jerry Lee Lewis and shit 
You act like the motherfucker's new at this shit 
But I've been true to this shit given' my heart and soul 
Been shinin' like a diamond but gettin' passed as coal 
So Fuck Off 
Yeah 
 
With my pants half hangin' off my ass and shit 
Bowl filled hash pockets stuffed with cash 
I be the mushroom trippin' sippin' shots of Jack 
'Cause the kids don't listen gettin' lots of flack 
I be the do wa diddy up and down you block and 
The 10 karat Kid with my triggers cockin' 
The K the I the D R-O-C K motherfucker and you still don't know me 
So blow me bitch I don't rock for *Edited* 
I rock for the cash and the topless dancers 
Don't have no answers so pass the joint 
I'm just paid in full and made in Detroit 
I ride like Setta in the Indy 5 
And get live with that which get's me high 
Strive for perfection this much is true 
We do what we say you say what we do 
Kid Rock I couldn't be no Bozo 
And I get too much nina 
*Edited* and my glock rolls solo to Arizona 
I'm an easy rider dreamin' of Wynonna 
I roam the country like a Greyhound bus 
Put faith in lust and in God I trust 
I'm not Peter Pan I don't fuck with fairies 
But I bust more rhymes than virgin cherries 
And Harry Carey couldn't call my game 
Fucked so many hoes I'm in the hall of fame 
And I show no shame from coast to coast 
I don't mean to brag, but I like to boast 
Fuck Off 
Yeah right in your mother fuckin' ass bitch 
With that Detroit city shit ain't shit swift we're on the same script 
Nothing new since 76 Kid Rock 
Yo Slim Shady come break these mother fuckers off 
 
(Eminem) 
Yo tell the world to hold their breath they're breathing the wrong air 
This planet belongs to me and this hippy with long hair 
Two Withe boys who spike punch and light joints 
Hang around drugs loud music and like noise 
Slim Shady and Brown Trucker another bunch of mother fuckers 
Who hate the world as much as each other 
And I ain't leaving this party tonight 
'Til I see some naked bitches dancin' around drunk touchin' each other 
Rum and Pepsi got your whole perception of me sketchy 
'Cause when I stage dive people are scared to catch me 
'Cause all I do is curse and fuck 
So when I do 'shrooms you all better give me two rooms 
'Cause I'm fuckin' the first one up 
So when you see me on your block you better lock your cars 
'Cause you know I'm losin' it when I'm rappin' to rock guitars 
This is for children who break rules 
People that straight fool 
And ever single teenager that hates school 
 
Fuck Off
