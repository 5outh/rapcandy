[Verse 1]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to pick it
But quick to get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Bridge:]
Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long

[Hook:]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, (go berzerk) shake your body

[Verse 2]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khaki's pressed, Nike shoes just crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made Em just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in dang, bang bang
Yes sir Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang dang
P-p-p-pow chicka pow chicka wow wow
Got your gal blowin' up a val-v-v-v-val-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, how, how, how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now hoe

[Bridge]

[Hook]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, (go berzerk) get your vials

[Scratches]

[Verse 3]
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard, drugs are though that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you a loan, car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers, shit head with a potty mouth
Get the bar soap lathered, Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl you’re fixin' to get your heart broke, don’t be absurd man
You birdbrain baby I ain’t called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you’re a swallow
Word, Rick word man you heard, but don’t be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

[Bridge]
