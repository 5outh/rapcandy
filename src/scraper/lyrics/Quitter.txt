[Eminem] 
Yo.. I dedicate to this.. to yo.. 
 
{*imitating Slick Rick*} 
To all my fans, keepin y'all in health 
Let's tell this Whitey Ford to go fuck himself 
Cause it's cruel when you cause a bad heart conditionin 
which I create, cause that's my mission 
So listen close, to what we say 
because this type of fag claims to never be gay, I.. 
 
{*rapping normally*} 
.. knew you was jealous from the day that I met you 
I upset you, cause I get respect I pet you (boy) 
I'm even liked better by your niece and nephew (c'mon!) 
And now you hate Fred because Lethal left you 
Peckerwood mad cause his record went wood 
No respect in the hood, fled to his neck of the woods 
Got in touch with his roots, found the redneck in his blood 
and said, "Heck, country western rap records are good!!" 
So he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes 
He can't rap, or sing, but he wants to do both (haha) 
Puts an album out and rules for part of the year 
then Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit come from out of nowhere 
It's the start of an era, rock rap's harder this year 
No one's tryin to hear some fuckin old fart in a chair 
sittin on stage, strummin acoustic guitar in your ear 
So you start to get scared, sit back and spark an idea 
Figure you can diss me to jump start your career 
I punch you in your fuckin chest 'til your heart kicks in gear (bitch) 
And fuck your underground buddy's nameless crew 
Like I'ma say they names so they can be famous too 
 
[Chorus 2X: Eminem *sung*] 
You just a.. quitter, and you bitter cause I came along 
and the days of House of Pain are gone 
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again 
I'ma kill you (I'ma kill you) 
 
[Eminem] 
Yo.. heart attack to stroke from the crack you smoke 
to the rap you wrote, your fuckin answer back's a joke 
And I'ma tell these motherfuckin fans the truth 
The reason why you dissed me first and I answered you 
You said I passed you in a lobby and I glanced at you 
like I ain't notice you?BITCH, I had a show to do! 
Like I'm supposed to be star-struck, come over to you 
You better shut your fuckin mouth while you oh-for-two 
Back in ninety-four Limp opened the show for you 
Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you 
Took your motherfuckin DJ and stole him too 
So you fall in a slump and get all emotional 
So now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings 
Confused as fuck cause now your music sucks dick 
Mr. Mr. Ass Kisser to get accepted in rap 
quicker but never last, and Everlast is a.. 
 
[Chorus] 
Aight listen (look) 
So this is what we ask of our fans 
If you ever see Everlast, WHOOP HIS ASS 
Hit him with sticks, bricks, rocks, throw shit at him 
Kick him, spit on him, treat him like a hoe, bitch-slap him 
Do it for me, do it for Fred, do it for Limp 
Do it for Rock, do it for rap, do it for Kid 
Do it for Ice-T, do it just to do it, fuck it 
He's a bitch, he ain't gon' hit you back, he's nothin! 
Shit in five years we'll all be "Eating at Whitey's" 
And he'll be bussin tables in that bitch, cleanin the toilets 
Aiyyo.. fuck this, cut this shit off 
 
{*music stops*} 
 
Aiyyo Head, that's why I fucked your mother you fat motherfucker! 
 
{*beat changes to 2Pac's "Hit 'Em Up"*} 
 
Kill Whitey! - Hahaha 
Kill Whitey! - Detroit!What?What? 
Kill Whitey! - .. yo, yo 
Kill Whitey! - Haha!Look 
 
First off, fuck your songs and the shit you say 
Diss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay 
You claim to be a Muslim but you Irish White 
So fuck you fat boy, drop the mic, let's fight 
Plus I punch you in the chest, weak hearts I rip 
Whitey Ford, forty and white, lethargic ass dickhead 
I keep 'em comin while you runnin out of breath 
Steady duckin while I'm punchin at your chest, you need to rest 
Dilated, go ask your people how I leave ya 
with your three CD's, nobody sees, when they released 
Evidence, don't fuck around with real MC's 
who ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks 
I let you faggots know it's on for life 
but Everlast might die tonight, haha 
Fat boy murdered on wax and killed 
Fuck with me and take a heart pill, you know! 
 
[Chorus: Eminem] 
Grab 380's when you see Slim Shady 
Call the doctor to heal your heart 
They shocked you back to life at the clinic 
but you 'bout to get relapsed any minute 
Honkey, I hit 'em up! 
 
Hahaha, yo check this out 
You faggots ain't even on my level 
I'ma let D-12 ride on you bitch-made ass faggots! 
 
[Kon Artis] 
Yo!Get out the way yo, get out the way yo 
Whitey Ford's heart just stopped 
Eminem shocked him back, he had another heart attack 
Whitey Ford's gettin his ass floored for talkin back 
Little faggot Hamburgular, I show you where the burgers are 
At your own restaraunt, while I'm servin ya 
Drop and stomp your whole heart 'til it stops 
Call the cops, I'ma beat your ass while they watch 
 
[Kuniva] 
Ha ha, now we got the whole industry makin fun of you Erik 
Where's your House of Pain now?There's only one of you Erik 
You a petty coward, you ain't ready to steady go a round 
with some killers from 7 Mile to the motherfuckin (?) Bridge 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Eminem] 
Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still 
this ain't no freestyle battle Everlast gettin killed 
with his chest open 
Tryin to throw a fuckin punch, but you just chokin 
Havin a stroke and now you learn why crackers never earned a dime 
cause you SUCK motherfucker you should learn to rhyme 
Talkin 'bout you packin pistols but it's funny to me 
You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me 
I'm a paleface killer whale 
on his way to fuckin prison, pistol whippin tail, ha 
Erik remember when I passed you in the lobby that day? 
That shit was obvious you probably was gay, ha 
Now it's all about country, you gave up hip-hop 
Forty-nine thousand copies, the week your shit drop 
while my sales makin records break 
Two and a half million scanned by the second week 
Motherfucker I hit 'em up! 
 
[Proof] 
I'm from Detroit's Pemberton Ave., where bullets tear you in half 
Fuck the music, we got an uzi for all you fags 
Get the shit out of our stereo, Dilated you violated 
Now you 'bout to get annihilated, we gon' bury you 
Iriscience get choked up and yoked up 
All you underground bitches get your throats cut 
 
[Swifty] 
What the fuck?!Is you stupid? 
I choke Whitey Ford with his fuckin guitar cord 
and stuff him in cardboard, chopped up in a box 
with sixteen parts, I stomped on his heart 
D-12, Amityville, fuck your mother while you watch 
Keep your restaraunt locked and block your door 
Cause we "Hit 'Em Up" like motherfuckin Tupac Shakur 
 
[Eminem] 
You a, "Black Jesus," heart attack seizures 
Too many cheeseburgers McDonald's Big Mac greases 
White devil, washed up honkey 
Mixed up cracker who crossed over to country 
 
{*laughing*} 
Yo, aiyyo cut this shit off 
{*needle drags, beat stops*} 
 
Fuck him, that's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm done, that's it 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I promise 
I just believe in kickin a man while he's down 
God damn!I quit 
Mention my daughter's name in a song again you fuckin punk 
Aiyyo..
