-RZA intro from "Airwaves"- 
[King Tech] 
One two, one two 
We dedicate this one to the hip-hop culture y'all 
Brought to you by the WOOOORRRLLLD FAMOUS Wake-Up Show! 
 
[RZA] 
Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled 
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass 
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin holes in you 
You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box 
Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin slow down the block 
One stopped, parks pops his trunk 
Snare pops loud as glock shots 
Bass like an M-80 in your face, cops stop, give us citation 
We pause for radio station identification 
WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP! 
 
[Tech N9NE] 
When I Woke-Up, I got the mic and never chocked up 
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned 
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin 
Look around, your town is crumblin 
This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin MC's lipless 
On The Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow 
Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper 
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper 
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo 
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter 
Sway   Tech heard me flow and its sealed 
Now I got Swedish women yelling "Tech N9NE's filled" 
 
[Eminem] 
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit Withe-out 
Cuz y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?) 
Climped out of a nice house, 
Through the front window and heard this guy shout 
"Hey that's my couch, bitch!" 
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout 
While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds 
And murder you hoes worse than flippin a convertible 
Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down 
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape 
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved 
And Sway   Tech, two disk jokeys 
Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject 
 
[Xzibit] 
Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold 
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul 
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll 
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold 
Cuz your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up 
Or listen to my niggas Tech   Sway so you can Wake-Up 
The X-man, catch me doin drills in the Danger Room 
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon 
 
[Pharoahe Monch] 
Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush 
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assualts in small interims 
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was 
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh 
So the head won't fall off, hauled-off 
Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked 
Why did he have to die like cast metal? 
O, huh, C now like Omar Credle 
We pone pedal at a high resolution 
On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution 
 
[Kool G Rap] 
I sway the tech wit the Tech and Sway 
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day 
Who over debt to pay get swept away 
Across the whole board like checker play 
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays 
Wake-Up Show for those slept away 
Niggas that the trey, hit the deck and pray 
DJ Revolution, spinnin like lead from out the heck-AK 
Tearin your neck away, flood up the street wit bloody decora' 
Until the head of jake investigate 
 
[Jayo Felony] 
What? Sway can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it 
Tech can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do? 
Rev can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it 
I can give it to you, Wha Wha Wha What What! 
 
[Chino XL] 
Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round 
Fuckin up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown 
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk 
What flow will I destroy wit this time, the most commonest thought 
The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry 
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me 
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all 
Wit style filed for sexual harrassment like Tisha Camp-bell 
You're wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy 
I fuckin murder your young style like JonBenet Ramsey 
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg' 
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a Withe cast on your leg 
I'm Wake-Up Show reppin wit Sway   Tech 
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon 
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in 
 
[KRS-One] 
De de de de de de da di day, KRS-One comin wit the Tech   Sway 
Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set 
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat 
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt 
You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet 
But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway   a Tech 
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect 
Nevertheless I WRECK YOU, now you know what Sway   Tech do 
I'll be back but for now just sackle! 
FRESH, FOR NINETY-NINE YOU SUCKAS!!!
