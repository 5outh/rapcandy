Well I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled 
Pop the same shit that got Tupac killed 
Spit game to these hoes, like a soap opera episode 
And punch a bitch in the nose, til her whole face explodes 
There's three things I hate: girls, women and bitches 
Smack bitches that walk up, and drop-kick midgets 
Call me Boogie Night, the stalker that walks awkward 
Stick figure, with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg 
Comin through the airport, sluggish, walkin on crutches 
Hit a fuckin [*pregnant chick*] in her [*stomach*] with luggage 
It's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out, and back out 
Lookin for some other thug, to beat the crap out 
I'm bringin you rap singers two middle fingers 
I flip you off in French, then translate in English 
Then I'ma vanish off the face of the planet and come back 
Speakin so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it

[Missy] Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim Shady

I had a huge attitude, started off staticky 
Mad at you, had you mad at me automatically (one more time) 
I'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity 
Who oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following 
It's so big, if I counted up all the freaks who follow me 
I'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology 
College girls, live in an alcoholic's world 
Full of earl, head twirls every time the toilet swirls *flush* 
Covered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up 
I won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up (SHUT UP!) 
I made this rap game suspenseful, cause now I got a impulse 
To give you insults wrote with a pencil (bitch) 
And waste the paper on you, choppin down the oakwood 
Cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good 
And as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin 
You motherfuckers are puttin your words together for nuttin 
 
[Missy] Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim Shady 
[Shady] What's the deal? 
[Missy] Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim motherfuckin Shady 
[Shady] Yeah.. who? 
[Missy] Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim Shady 
[Shady] What's the deal? 
[Missy] Won't you busa rhyme for me boy ..

Turn the music up, we gon' wake the neighbors 
We gon' get high, we gon' roll to Vegas 
Me and Slim Shady, on some shit daily 
What you want what you got is it hot? (Is it hot?) 
 
Turn the music up, we gon' wake the neighbors 
We gon' get high, we gon' roll to Vegas 
Me and Slim Shady, on some shit daily 
What you want (yo) what you want (yo) ahh uhh yo 
 
"A person from another planet might disagree with you" 
"Well if you want my opinion, it comes from right here on Earth"

I'm homicidal, and suicidal with no friends 
Holdin a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends 
Sprayin tecs at you until you see your fuckin legs 
With the bullet holes and the exit wounds layin next to you 
(AHH!) Fuckin mad dog, foamin at the mouth 
Fuck mouth, my whole house, is foamin at the couch 
Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a building 
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground (KEEP FILMING!) 
Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed, chopped em in half 
Suffocated the oxygen mask 
Shit if I get any higher, I'ma get the East and West beefin again 
Slide back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire 
 
[Missy] 
Y'all better call the police 'fore I kill this track 
Don't shoot Missy!!! Get back 
Uhh, I'ma put you all in the line 
Uhh, and I'ma watch you MC's die 
Yo mommy, mommy, Missy done lost her mind! 
I think somebody done pissed her off this time! 
Yo, I'ma have to bust you through your chest and 
Uhh, you will have to clean up the mess (uh-huh) 
It's rainin rainin and it's pourin loud 
Never fear, cause pissy Missy's through the crowd 
Uhh, I hear the gats go cha-pow 
Who shot me damnit? Bitch get down 
Don't walk when I talk, I never talk when I smile (uh-huh) 
Lay em on down, like they lived underground (uh) 
For the sound, that me and, Timbaland, we found 
Get your ass, kicked later, or get your ass, kicked now 
 
Uhh.. one-two 
Misdemeanor, Slim Shady 
Timbaland, motherfucker 
Uhh uhh uhh 
Cool, cool, cool 
Triple zero
