[Chorus] 
The way you shake it, I can't believe it 
I ain't never seen an ass like that 
The way you move it, you make my pee pee go 
Doing, doing, doing 

I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true 
I ain't never seen an ass like that 
The way you move it, you make my pee pee go 
Doing, doing, doing 

The way she moves she's like a belly dancer 
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams, I 
Think someones at the door 
But I don't think I'm gonna answer 
Police saying freeze 
Doing, doing, doing 
What do you mean freeze? 
Please, I'm a human being, I have needs 
I'm not done, not till I'm finish peeing 
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing Mr. Officer 
I'm already on my knees 
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me 
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee, pee, pee 
Yes, I make r&b, I sing song it go 
Ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching 
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kidd, I kidd 
If I offend I'm sorry, please, please forgive 
For I am Triumph, the puppet dog, I am a mere puppet 
I can get away with anything I sing, you will love it 

[Chorus] 

Jessica Simpson, looks oh so temptin' 
Nick I ain't never seen an ass like that 
Everytime I see that show on MTV my pee pee goes 
Doing, doing, doing 

Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome 
Now they're getting older, they're starting to grow bum bums 
I go to the movies and sit down with my pop corn 
Police saying freeze 
Doing doing doing 
What do you mean freeze? 
Geez, I just got my seat 
I have ticket, look I put away, my zipper's zipped 
Please do not remove me from this movie theater please 
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate shower scene 
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene 
And don't treat me like I'm pee wee herman, this movies PG 
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney 
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea and be free 
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets 
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy? 
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man 
And I can say that and you'll laugh cuz that is a puppet on my hand 

[Chorus] 

Hilary Duff is not quite old enough so 
I ain't never seen a butt like that 
Maybe next year I'll say ass and she'll make my pee pee go 
Doing, doing, doing 

The way she moves she dances like a go-go 
In that video she sings get out you bozo
I need a new boyfriend, hi my name is JoJo 
Police saying freeze 
Doing, doing, doing 
What do you mean freeze? 
My computers would be seized and my keys to my ranch 
I just baked cookies Mr. Officer, looky, take a whiff of these 
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this 
Nobody is safe from me, no not even me 
I don't even know if I can say the word pee pee, pee 
On the radio, but I think I did 
Janet, is that a breast, I think I just saw a tit 
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kidd, I kidd 
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick 
Get to the chopper, everybody get out 
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down 

[Chorus] 

So Gwen Stefani, will you pee pee on me please? 
I ain't never seen an ass like that 
Cuz the way you move it, you make my pee pee go 
Doing, doing, doing 

Fuck is wrong with you? (ha!)
