(Eminem Speaking) 
Most people don't see how much work is really involved 
in this rap shit 
I didn't know it 
I didn't see it 
I never saw it until i was actually in it 
You really gotta be in it 
To understand what its like 
But you always gotta 
People always gotta see your smile 
You always gotta put on that fake 
You know what i'm sayin 
No matter what u just been through 
 
(B-Real) 
So you wanna be a rap superstar 
And live large a big house 
5 cars, you're in charge 
Comin up in the world 
Don't trust nobody 
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly 
 
(B-Real) 
I remember the days when i was a young kid growin up 
Lookin in the mirror dreamin about blowin up 
To rock crowds make money 
Chill wit the honies 
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me 
Shits funny 
How impossible cream manifest in the games that be comin with it 
Never the less you gotta go for the gusto 
But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears 
and losin some of your peers 
And losin some of your self 
Music has past gone by 
Hopefully you don't manifest for the wrong guy 
Egomaniac in the brainiac 
Don't know how to act 
Shits deep 
48 tracks 
Studio gangsta mack 
Sign a deal emcees wanna make a mill 
But never will 
Till he crosses over still 
Feelin no hate 
But fantasies come wit these 
Just to sacrifice the taste of makin cheese 
You wanna be a rap superstar in the biz 
And take shit from people who don't know what it is 
I wish it was all fun and games 
But the price of fame is high 
And some can't pay to play 
Trapped in what you rappin about 
Tell me what happened when you lost clout 
The rout you took started collapsing 
No fans 
No fame 
No respect 
No change 
No women 
And everyone shits on your name 
 
(Chorus) 
So you wanna be a rap superstar 
And live large 
A big house 
5 cars 
The rent charged 
Comin up in the world don't trust nobody 
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly 
To be a rap superstar 
And live large 
A big house 
5 cars 
The rent charged 
Comin up in the world don't trust nobody 
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly 
 
(Noreaga Speaking) 
When you sign to a record label 
You don't know you sign your life over 
And these Witheboys don't care about you 
Cuz the minute you fall off 
They'll find another Noreaga 
And they'll find another Capone-n-Noreaga 
And they'll find another B-Real 
So you need to just keep 
Stack your chips up 
Do what you gotta do while your hot 
And mafuckin get out the game 
Stick to the drug game 
And the drug game is even worse 
Because if someone jerks you 
You can shoot em and kill me 
But in this game if someone jerks you 
You gotta be humble 
 
(Eminem Speaking) 
No matter what you just been through 
Shit has gotta be right 
You gotta approach people 
You gotta be on the up and up 
And everything gotta be all good 
When you see someone slap hands with em 
You know what i'm sayin give em a pound 
Or whatever it is 
But you always gotta act like it ain't shit 
 
(Chorus) 
 
(B-Real) 
My own son don't know me 
Sittin up in the hotel room lonley 
But I thank god I'm wit my homies 
But sometimes I wish I was back home 
But only no radio or videos 
Cuz they show me no love 
The phony gotta hit the road slowly 
So the record gets pushed by sony 
I'm in the middle like monie 
And the press say that 
My own people disowned me 
And the best way back 
Is to keep your head straight 
Never inflate the cranium 
Your crew worried about them honies at the paladium 
Who just wanna cling on swing on 
And so on and go on and fall off 
The hoes fall off 
To the next rap superstar 
Wit no shame give him a year 
And they'll be right out the game 
The same as the last one 
Who came before him 
Gained fame 
Started gettin ignored 
I warned him 
Assured him 
This ain't easy take it from weezy 
Sleezy people wanna be cheesey 
They talkin evil 
 
(Chorus)
