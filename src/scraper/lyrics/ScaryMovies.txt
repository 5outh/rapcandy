[R5] Yo, Royce 5-9 
[Em] Y'all wanna make a movie? 
[R5] What.. 
[Em] We got the film right here 
 
[Royce] 
What? 
Yeah I'm one of them pretty rappers 
Buck if I really hafta, I really slap ya 
King of Detroit who they namin the city after (what?) 
Scandalous partners, whose grammar hammers the hard shit 
Into your heart with, content, yo who wanna start with 
Experts, Bad and Evil is comin soon 
MC's get stuck, head first back in they mother's womb 
This shit is written, in my eyes I'm the illest MC spittin (what?) 
Leavin all of you cats shittin kittens 
I gotta diss you, my niggaz be cockin pistols 
Shot and split you, fuck splittin the profits with you (what?) 
Six percent, of y'all niggaz is just pretend 
Clicks with clits, pussy niggaz stink with dicks (what?) 
Niggaz act bully, and blast for the fast penny 
My auto is fully, plenty of niggaz packin semi 
Speak darts; yo you get paid? Rhymin about it is the sweet part 
You can't be street smart with a cheap heart 
Five Nine, a street nigga with deep feelin (what?) 
I keep illin, my steez willin to keep killin (what?) 
Fuck rap, a lot of y'all all is just acts 
Trust that - you rhyme all wack on rough tracks 
Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at 
Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at 
And I'ma spit thunder (what?) stick to my guns 
Niggaz is finished before they gimmicks, one-hit wonders 
What? Big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls 
I'ma pit bull, I'm just dog, I'm just raw (what?) 
Split y'all, holla, "It's on!" Then I diss y'all 
All of y'all niggaz get pissed on claimin you pissed off 
 
[Eminem and Royce] 
Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie? 
Rappers comin in with they team and carry toolies 
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me 
We hard-hittin, directin and starrin in it

[Eminem] 
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon 
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin 
Any man plannin to battle will get snatched out of his clothes 
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standin 
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail 
Bill Clinton, hit this, and you better inhale 
Cause any MC that chooses to go against me 
Is gettin takin advantage of like Monica Lewinksy (Leave me alone!) 
Came home in a frenzy, pushin a ten speed 
Screamin to Aunt Peg (AUNT PEG!!!!) 
With three spokes stickin out of my pant leg 
Fuck a headache, give me a migraine 
Damnit I like pain (AHH!) 
And you should be anywhere that I might gain 
You rap knowin you wack 
You act up and I'm throwin you down a flight of steps 
Then I'm throwin you back up em 
If they don't like the track, fuck em 
The rap struck em harder then gettin hit by a Mack truck 
And then backed up on 
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass 
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch (Ding! Ding!) 
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly (Hurry up man!) 
I'm sicker than a Tupac dedication to Biggie 
I'm free-fallin feet first out of a damn tree 
To stampede your chest till you can't breathe 
And when I'm down to my last breath 
I'ma climb the Empire State Building and get to the last step 
And still laugh half bent
