I know sometimes things may not always 
make since to you right now 
but hey what did daddy always tell 
straighten up lil soldier 
stiffin up that upper lip 
what you cryin about? 
you got me... 

Verse: 
Halie i know you miss your mom 
and i know you miss your dad when im gone 
but im tryin to give you the life that i never had 
i can see your sad, even when you smile 
even when you laugh i can see it in your eyes 
deep inside you wanna cry cause your scared 
i aint there, daddy's with you in your prayers 
no more cryin, wipe them tears 
daddy's here, no more nightmares 
we gonna pull together through it 
we gon do it, laney uncle's crazy 
but he loves you baby and you better know it 
we're all we got in this world when it spins 
when it swirls, when it whirls, when it twirls 
two little beautiful girls lookin puzzled 
in a daze, i know its confusin you 
daddys always on the move 
momma's always on the news 
i try to keep you sheltered from it 
but somehow it seems the harder that i try 
to do that the more it backfires on me 
all the things growin up as daddy 
that he had to see, daddy dont want you to see 
but you see just as much as he did 
we did not plan it to be this way 
your mother and me but things have go so bad between us 
i dont see us ever being together ever again 
like we used to be when we was teenagers 
but then of course everything always happens for a reason 
i guess it was never meant to be but 
its just something we have no control over 
and thats what destiny is 
but no more worries, rest your head 
and go to sleep 
maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream 

Chorus: 
Hush little baby dont you cry 
everything's gonna be alright 
stiffin that upper lip up little lady 
i told ya, daddy's here to hold ya 
through the night 
i know mommy's not here right now 
and we don't know why we feel how we feel inside 
it may seem a little crazy pretty baby 
but i promise, momma's gon be alright 

Verse 2: 
its funny, i remember back when you and daddy had no money 
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up and stuck em 
under the tree and said some of them were from me 
cause daddy couldn't buy em 
ill never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night crying 
cause daddy felt like a bum 
see daddy had a job, but his job was to keep the food 
on the table for you and mom and at the time 
every house that we lived in 
either kept gettin broken into and robbed 
or shot up on the block 
and your mom was savin money for you in a jar 
tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college 
almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it 
and i know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart 
and it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart 
mom and dad was arguin a lot 
so momma moved back on charmas in a flat one bedroom apartment 
and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Novara 
and thats when daddy went to California with his cd 
and met dr. dre who flew you and momma out to see me 
but daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me 
then you started seein daddy on the tv 
and momma didn't like it 
and you and laney were to young to understand it 
papa was a rolling stone, momma developed a habit 
and it all happened to fast for either one of us to grab it 
im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand 
cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud 
now im sittin in this empty house 
just reminiscing looking at your baby pictures it just trips me out 
to see how much you both have grown, its like you're sisters now 
wow, i guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here 
laney, im talkin to you too, daddy's still here 
i like the sound of that, yeah 
its gotta ring to it dont it, shhh, momma's only gone for the moment 

Chorus: 
Hush little baby dont you cry 
everything's gonna be alright 
stiffin that upper lip up little lady 
i told ya, daddy's here to hold ya 
through the night 
i know mommy's not here right now 
and we don't know why we feel how we feel inside 
it may seem a little crazy pretty baby 
but i promise, momma's gon be alright 
and if you ask me to daddys gonna buy you a mockingbird 
im gon give you the world 
im'a buy a diamond ring for you im'a sing for you 
i'll do anything for you to see you smile 
and if that mockinbird dont sing and that ring dont shine 
im'a break that birdie's neck 
i'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya 
and make him eat every karot, dont fuck with dad.
