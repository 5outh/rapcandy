Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke 
Throw you in a choke - gun smoke, gun smoke 
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer 
The hooker layer - motherfucker say your prayers 
Hail Mary full of grace.. smack the bitch in the face; 
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face 
Off her back, jab her if she act 
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey 
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper 
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like, "The Vapors" 
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho, the head honcho 
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so 
Much style I should be down wit the Stylistics 
Make up to break up {*singing in background*} niggaz need to wake up 
Smell the indonesia; beat you to a seizure 
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins til amnesia 
She don't remember shit! Just the two hits! 
Her hittin the floor, and me hittin the clits! 
Suckin on the tits! Had the hooker beggin for the dick 
And your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick 
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown 
I was "Humpin Around" and "Jump-in Around" 
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man; she said, "B-I-G" 
Then I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo Big, you're dead wrong)

When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard 
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted 
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh 
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it 
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G 
Disrespect me - my potency is deadly 
I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes 
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy 
Slit the wrist of little sis 
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick 
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back 
But Smalls don't get down like that 
Got your father hidin in a room; fucked him with the broom 
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound 
Who you think you're dealin with? 
Anybody step into my path is fuckin feelin it! 
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy 
Stab ya til you're gushy, so please don't push.. me 
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen 
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin 
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green 
With no hair in between, know what I mean?

There's several different levels to Devil worshippin: horse's heads, 
Human sacrifices, canibalism; candles and exorcism 
Animals havin sex with 'em; camels mammals and rabbits 
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit - I just, 
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh 
And I never eat you unless the fuckin, meat looks fresh 
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin, I got a nine in my pocket 
And baby I'm just, dyin to cock him 
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war 
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw 
My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before 
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before 
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor 
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall 
Red on the ceilin, red on the floor, get a new whore 
Met on the second, wet on the third; 
Then she's dead on the fourth - I'm dead wrong
