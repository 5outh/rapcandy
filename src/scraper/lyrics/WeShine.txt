[Verse One] 
I'm rockin shit, packin shit, while stackin shit 
If anyone steps up askin shit, I'm blastin shit 
You gone phase me, but swingin like Peter Parker 
Motherfuck the shop, I'll wreck the Goddamn barber 
Forget your dreams about being with fans hugged up 
You couldn't be a dope MC if you said his rhymes drugged up 
I told you once, but you forget so here's a flashback 
"You couldn't be shit, if you came out my asscrack" 
Stop frontin kid, you know you ain't paid 
And the only mic/Mike you wrecked was that kid you fought in first grade 
Ain't nothin lyrical about you but your lies 
So cut the shit, cause its startin to draw flies 
You're played like my five-year old's newborn toys 
Don't know shit about Chicago, but I could still make Illa Noyz 
Like Robin Leech I display stylish ways 
Thats rough like my face when I haven't shaved in days 
Listen up, all these words take heed 
When I cock and squeeze, no more MC's breathe (none) 
I'm sick of this, here's my final dis 
Fuck you dumb niggaz you ain't shit like this

[Eminem] 
My Smith and Wessy got you layin in some alley messy 
Got your family lookin for your ass on Sally Jesse 
We squash beef in the mo', when you ain't breathin no more 
Leavin your skull split like Steven Seagal 
Let the cat out, flat out, Detroit's a mad house 
So I don't get offended when I hear my city badmouthed 
We quick to pull the gat out and set it 
And leave you with more shit missin than a Lil' Kim radio edit 
Stick up kids be tryin to live paid 
You get your grill sprayed with twenty-seven bullets in your ribcage 
Get the guage, cock it back, empty your pockets, Jack 
Or I'ma send you flyin like a rocketpack 
Murder you for a bag of chips and a chocolate snack 
Break into your crib still your shit and lock it back 
Ten-year old kids be standin on the block with gats 
Just for livin nowadays'll get you flocked with bats 
Where I'm from...yaknow what'm sayin?, that's some old Detroit shit 
y'all wouldn't know about that shit, though. Less you come 
to my city, ya know what'm sayin? See where we live, 
cause we shine

[Hush] 
MC's put Detroit up in they rap songs 
Cause without us there careers wouldn't last long 
So like a generation we've been passed on 
Now its our time to shine, put your glasses on 
Got these A   R's and labels with binoculars 
Lookin in, jockin us and not jockin yours 
Too many groups follow trends, unoriginal 
Usin loops that transcend every bitch in you 
Don't ever try to say this is a ghost town 
One million rappers in this bitch, they need to slow down 
Evualute the situation, all the rest are killers 
Fly hoes out on Jefferson with the drug dealers 
Two years in the joint, nobody's touchin Hush 
Try to say you'll put us down, but your under us 
Now who the fuck are you? its just coincidental 
When your rhyme your even worse than the instrumental 
Your just a phone-tapper with no backbone 
Talkin shit, I got a clique that only pack chrome 
Have your ass gone, nowhere to run, when we hit 
Next time you'll think twice of who you fuckin wit
