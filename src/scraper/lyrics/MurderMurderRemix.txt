[Chorus: Eminem (repeat 4X)]

It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)

[Eminem]
Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands
the shit is in my hands, here's yo' lifespan
And for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lamp in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin, clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
or gets your description and sketches ya
The connection was the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cause I got a daughter to feed
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King
And have the lady at the desk bring
money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin the Mac
Cooperate, and we can operate, and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked
But I slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin "Freeze"
But I'm already wanted for sellin ki's
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit be square in the chest, wasn't wearin a vest
Left the house, pullin out the drive backin out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin out
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face
Shut your yackin mouth, 'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinkin fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car, made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl in "Set It Off" did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin: "Son, go in and call the police
Tell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin like they never seen nobody hit a ;ick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
and collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin "TRUCE TRUCE"
and surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me!  It was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps

[Chorus]
