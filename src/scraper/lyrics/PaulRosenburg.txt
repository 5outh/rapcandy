Paul Rosenberg Speaking On Answering Machine

Em, it's Paul, listen...
Joe Just called me and he told me you're in the fuckin
back behind the studio...
Shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range...
I told you not to fuckin bring your gun around like an idiot...
Outside of your home, you're gonna get yourself in trouble...
DON'T BRING your gun outside of your home you can't
carry it on you...
Leave the fucking gun at home!
