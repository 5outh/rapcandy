[Eminem]
This motherfucker here, just wont shut up will you 
Talk about I owe you, bitch you owe me 
Promote me right now 
Man lets put the nail in his coffin 

[Chorus]
I dont want to be like this 
I dont really want to hurt no feelins 
But Im only bein real when I say nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap 
Old men have heart attacks 
and I dont want to be responsible for that so 
Put the mic down and walk away 
You can still have a little bit of dignity 

[verse 1]
I would never claim to be no great Benzino 
an 83 year old fake Pachino 
So how can he hold me over some balcony 
without throwin his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me 
Please dont, youl probably fall with me 
and our asses will both be history 
But then again youl finnally get your wish 
cuz youl be all over the street like 50 Cent 
Fuckin punk pussy fuck you chump 
gimme a one-on-one see if I dont fuck you up 
Tryin to jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up 
And you put Jada on a track thats how much you suck 
duck in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin 
You sit behind a fuckin desk at The Source butt-kissin 
and beggin motherfuckers for guest appearences 
and you can even get the clearances cuz real lyricists 
dont even respect you or take you serious 
Its not that we dont like you, we hate you - period 
Talk about a mid-life crisis damn 
last week you was shakin Obie Trice's hand 
Now hes a busta What the fucks with that 
Get on a track dissin us kissin 50's ass 
and askin me what I know about inditements-bite me 
bitch I got two cases, and probation - fight me! 
What do I know about standin in front of a judge like a man 
ready to take whatever sentence he hands 
What you know about your wife slicin her wrists 
right in front of the only thing you have in this world - a little girl 
And I put that on her, when this is all over 
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her 
I dont know shit about no shoppin rocks 
But what you know about hip-hop shops rockin spots 
When your the only white boy in that bitch just rippin 
pressin up your own flyers and your stickers stickin 
them bitches up after spendin six hours at Kinkos 
Just makin copys of your covers of casette singles 
and sell them out the trunk of your Tracer 
Spendin your whole paycheck at Disc Makers 
What you know about bein bullied over half your life 
Oh thats right, you know what thats like, your half white 
Vanilla Ice,spill the beans and rice, Im eaten you alive inside 
Jesus Christ, if your that much of a gangster, put the mic down 
You should be out killin motherfuckers right now 
Kill a motherfucker dead, kill'em dead bitch 
Shoot'em in the fuckin head, go ahead bitch 
Slap my mom, slap the f*ck outa her! 
She cant sue you, she wouldnt get a buck out of you 
Cuz your broke as fuck you suck your a fuckin joke 
If you was really sellin coke, well then what the fuck 
you stop for dummy If you slew some crack 
you'd make alot more money than you do from rap 
You never had no security, you'll never be famous 
You'l never now what its like to be rich, lifes a bitch aint it 
Raymond, here, let me break this shit down in lamens 
terms for you just to make sure that you can understand this 
and Canibus they usin too many complicated fuckin words for you 
Here then let me slow it down for you 
so you can understand if I say it slower: 
Let it go dawg it's over 

[Chorus]

[Eminem talkin]
Haha 
Talkin bout I have motherfuckers callin your crib 
bitch you aint even got a fuckin crib 
You aint even got a fuckin phone, fuckin punk 
Threatened to shut me down at your little fuckin Source magazine 
if I come back then you would attack me, bitch you attacked me first 
take it like a man and shut the fuck up 
and fuck your little magazine too 
I dont need your fuckin magazine, I got XXL number anywayz 
And yall cant stand it cuz there gettin bigger than yall 
oh, and by the way, howed I look on the VMAs 
When you was watchin me from whatever fuckin TV you was watchin me from in Boston 
The mean streets of Boston, fuckin sissy 
Like you got us scared in the motherfucker, suck our motherfuckin dicks 
Oh, and for those thats dont know, dont get it twisted yo, the Source has a white owner
