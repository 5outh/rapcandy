*after shoutouts and talking* 
 
[Eminem] 
Peace to Thirstin Howl, A.L. and Wordsworth 
My mother smoked crack, I had a premature birth 
I'm just a nerd cursed, wit badly disturbed nerves 
Who wanna be the one to step up and get served first? 
Ninety-nine percent of aliens prefer earth 
So I'm here to rule the planet, startin wit your turf 
I hid a secret message inside of a wordsearch 
Wit smeard letters, runnin together in blurred spurts 
I hang wit male chauvinist pigs and perverts 
Who point water pistols at women and squirt shirts 
Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerber's 
My first words were "Bleep bleep" and "Curse curse" 
Never had ish, and I still don't deserve dirt 
My breath still stinks and I'm on my third Certs 
Yankin out my stitches, hollering "Nurse nurse!" 
"You said this shot would numb it, trick it just hurts worse!" 
Grew up in a dump next door to a burnt church 
But gunshots drowned out crickets and bird chirps 
And it's like that, and it's like that 
 
[Evidence] 
Got no apathy 
Yo I Platform my strategy, mix words in alchemy 
Evidence, I won't get caught shot on the balcony 
Between you and I, I'll tell you here's the diff 
Gun to your head, you're dead, pointblank I shapeshift 
That's right, to dear/deer, anelope, or owl 
In life, use your potential, or Steve Howe 
I'm about to call it quits, yo too much weight'll break your rack mount 
The man'll make you move, yo so make your move a backout 
You say I use my name too much as a clutch 
Try holdin on to beat instead of pushin on your crutch 
Flipped it backwards, Evidence attack nerds off the head 
Steadfast, right or left, don't matter see you comin 
Deaf/Def like Leppards, pop the piece, I be the sheppard 
Causin the herd, the name is Ev absurd 
Verbs get flipped, it's like this, yo acronyms and all that 
Methaphor imagery, you claimin metaphors and spittin similies 
Not havin It, the name is Evidence 
Like Pos. K gibbin the life thinkin of stabbin it 
Skills prevail you possess, take no offense 
But don't profess lies within your mind, tempt and stress 
 
[Iriscience] 
It's like uh-oh-oh 
It's Dilated Peoples on the Wake Up Show-uh-oh 
We kick a lick or some for the radio-uh-oh 
Yo CaTashTrophic like Rico *fades out*
