(Mr. Eon)- "Iron Mic Trilogy" 
(Erik Sermon)- "back with the...funky...beats" 
 
Mr. Eon: 
Packing the third eye rush you it's cyclopse 
They trade in their high tops for night sized Withe rocks 
Words in my right, they pass my left ear 
It's solid decked out write the books for next year 
Bear this grenade you got stuck like virgin 
Who that cat splurgin' instead or rehearsin? 
Tough guy, dj travi your high rise 
Looking more like ronald then the fuckin fry guys 
Go on uptown fucking senoritas 
In Taco Bell screaming "vivas gorditas!" 
Bring all your dogs i give em rabies 
They never had a chance i might chew up all their babies 
(Eminem: waaah!) 
Pope John Paul the second, brain like satan 
Have your beaten girlfriend cooking up bacon 
I'm obituite with that shit that you hit 
Slow my flick with ya cause mine to pick wit her 
 
Eminem: 
My nine is limpin ya six deep when i spray rounds 
Hit you with 12 shots in mid air and four more on the way down 
The eight straight strays to a kid's hair on the playground 
You lay down on a stretcher (Don't get carried away now!) 
No pun intended, snapped out of your whip 
And leave it un-attended before i whip out this gun and hit it 
Unless you want it dented with bullet holes any minute 
Cause i can leave your Infinite full of those even if someone's in it 
Snap the airbag, hit the corner and park it 
You wanted a market, i got her tied up in a chair and gag 
Bitches get smacked and grabbed by the hair and dragged 
Like cave-women, while i'm grave diggin' with Marilyn Man 
 
Mr. Eon: 
If you got a bowl of hash better cash it 
Dollar signs flashin' i'ma take the last hit 
 
Eminem: 
And if you're spitting whack shit on the microphone 
I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast i'm gonna detach it 
 
Mr. Eon: 
If you got a bowl of hash better cash it 
Dollar signs flashin' i'ma take the last hit 
 
Eminem: 
I'm flabergasted off two tabs of acid 
Threw my baby's mother in a nap sack and latched it 
 
Mr. Eon: 
Yo, "Eon's whack now", how you dig that? 
Couldn't get on my record if you were street rap 
Get the greater rate with these rhymes i be totin' 
Let's go back online and jerk off on your modem 
I got stupid mucus from these loose lips 
My loose leaf leave your whole persona weak 
To the point when you stand up on your feet {you} best retreat 
Let's go back in time and steal my whole seed 
The quickening, did a ?briss? at the crispening 
I'm exercisin', to uplifting the foot stage 
This thing's the nicest, i keep telling you 
What the fuck this guy on the corner been selling you? 
(Eminem: "here buy this") 
 
Eminem: 
I'm e-mailing you, at the wrong website 
Mispelling you, break you and put the fear of hell in you 
Escape above you, stuff the nurse in a purse 
Disperse like i added too many words in a verse 
Slim Shady, a perverted virgin at birth {or "version of birth"} 
Driving off, leaving the murdered virgin at church 
The first person searching the earth for the motherfucker 
That pulled the plug when they shoulda alerted the surgeon first 
You don't curse and hit with your own words 
Leave me alone bitch! I get on my own nerves 
And if i don't got two balls and a middle finger to throw up 
Then i'm takin' off both shoes and stickin' each middle toe up (fuck y'all!) 
 
Mr. Eon: 
If y'all got a bowl of hash better cash it 
Dollar signs flashin' i'ma take the last hit (Eminem: "gimmie that") 
 
Eminem: 
And if you're spitting whack shit on the microphone 
I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast i'm gonna detach it 
 
Mr. Eon: 
So if you got a bowl of has better cash it 
Dollar signs flashin' i'ma take the last hit 
 
Eminem: 
I'm flabergasted off two tabs of acid 
Threw my baby's mother in a hatch-back and latched it 
 
Eminem: 
Any disease out there i'm willing to catch it.... 
Slim Shady.....All praises 
To the High   Mighty
