[Mr. Eon] 
Packin this third eye, pursue a Cyclops 
They trade in they high tops for nice sized Withe rocks 
(Excuse me) Words in my right, that pass my left ear 
Your style is ass-out like the Bulls are next year (you're GONE) 
Fear this veneer, you get stung like virgins 
Who that cat splurgin instead of rehearsin? 
Tough guys, degentrify your high rise 
Lookin more like Ronald than them fuckin Fry Guys 
Go on uptown fuckin senoritas 
In Taco Bell screamin, "Viva gorditas!" 
Bring all your dogs - I give em rabies 
They never had a chance like my two aborted babies (WAAAH!) 
Got Pope John Paul the 2nd, prayin to Satan 
Have your vegan girlfriend cookin up bacon 
on barbituates with that shit that you hit 
Smoke my spliffs withcha, cause spinal bifida 
 
[Eminem] 
My nine is liftin ya, six feet when I spray rounds 
Hit you with 12 shots in mid-air and four more on the way down 
as eight strays graze through a kid's hair on the playground 
You lay down on a stretcher (Don't get carried away now!) 
No pun intended, just hop out of your whip 
and leave it un-attended before I whip out this gun and end it 
Unless you want it dented with bullet holes any minute 
Cause I can leave your Infinite full of those even if someone's in it 
Snatch the airbag, hit the corner and park it 
Corner the market, I got her tied up in a chair and gagged 
Bitches get smacked and grabbed by the hair and dragged 
like cavewomen, while I'm gravediggin with Marilyn Man' 
 
Chorus: Mr. Eon, Eminem 
 
If you got a bowl of hash better cash it 
You got a satchel, flash it, I'ma take your last hit 
And if you spittin wack shit on the microphone 
I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast I'ma detach it 
So if you got a bowl of hash, you better cash it 
You got a satchel, flash it, I'ma take your last hit 
I'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid 
Threw my baby's mother in the hatchback and latched it 
 
[Mr. Eon] 
Yo yo, "Eon's wack now," how you think that? 
Couldn't get on my record if you were shrink rap (can I get a rhyme?) 
Desecrate a crate with these rhymes I be totin 
Let's go back online and jerk off on your modem 
I got stupid mucus from these loose lips 
My loose leaf leave your whole persona weak 
to the point that you stand up on your feet, best retreat 
Let's go back in time and steal my whole steez 
The Quickening, did a bris at the christening 
I'm exercisin, doing liftings and twistings 
Instinct's the nicest, I keep tellin you 
What the fuck this guy on the corner been sellin you? 

[Eminem]
(Here - buy this) I'm e-mailin you, at the wrong website 
and mispellin you, prank you and put the fear of hell in you 
Escaped Bellevue, stuffed the nurse in a purse 
Disperse like I added too many words in a verse 
Slim Shady, a perverted version of birth 
Drivin off, leaving a murdered virgin at church 
The first person who searchin the earth for the motherfucker 
that pulled the plug when they shoulda alerted the surgeon first 
(Kill his ass) Get thrown curves, and hit with your own words 
Leave me alone bitch! I get on my own nerves 
And if I don't got two balls and a middle finger to throw up 
I'm takin off both shoes and stickin each middle toe up 
(Fuck y'all!!!!) 
 
Chorus 
 
[Eminem] 
Any disease out there I'm willin to catch it... 
Slim Shady... 
All praises to The High   Mighty
