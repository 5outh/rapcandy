Eminem: Aite 
Fred Durst: Check! Slim Shady, do the mic. kid 
 
(Eminem) 
I don't do black music 
I don't do Withe music 
I make fight music 
For High School kids 
I pull side full grips 
When I drive like this {screech} 
With a slipped disk 
 
From a Limp Bizkit diss 
I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts 
So I get pissed and can't pick which wrist to slit 
Little rich kids in cribs 
Don't attempt this shit 
Just step back 
While I prep up to pimp this bitch 
So I said to the girl, I'm like 
"What up girl?" 
"Shut up girl!" 
And showed her a cut-up squirrel 
She screamed bloody murder so loud everybody heard her 
Slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer 
I moved on to two blondes 
And kissed 'em on a futon 
{Ay yo baby!} 
{What do you want?!} 
I looked at 'em both and I was like 
"Look, check this out toots, I'm lookin' for cookie pus" 
I need to speak to 'em immediately
They played my video on MTV last week 
And just when I was thinkin' I was all that and then some 
In comes Fred Durst 
 
(Fred Durst) 
Yo Shady let me get some 
Who knows what galaxy I came from 
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair 
Now I'm a nightmare 
You stay right there 
I got the diva 
Hold the flavor of a single 
See me and Shady? 
I think we got a lock down 
Shocked by the sound 
I got you cruisin' with your top down 
These two blondes 
I offered 'em both a drink 
And this you would think 
Could get the party started 
But instead them girls turned their heads 
Opened up their mouths 
Smelt like somebody farted 
So if it's time for me to move on 
Shady said the livin' room was a dance floor 
So turn me loose 
I was cuttin' the rug with this chick 
Bumped into this dude who was drunk 
And a prick 
Ramblin' on about how 
He was gonna kill me 
Wow! 
I spilled a drink on his shirt 
But no- He insisted we should go 
Before I could drop 'em 
Shady had to clock 'em 
The music stopped 
The party stood in shock 
So I looked around 
Grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf 
 
Turn me loose 
Turn me loose 
Turn me loose 
Turn me loose 
This party's goin' my way 
Or no way at all 
But don't you 
Turn me loose 
Turn me loose 
Turn me loose 
This party's goin' my way 
Or no way at all 
 
(Eminem) 
Turn me loose 
You better tell 'em to come re-shingle the roof 
Just keep feedin' me free drinks till I puke 
And Fred'll ask me to lead sing in his group 
I'm sick at the barn 
I'm not bein' approached 
Cuz Fred's over there stealin' all of my hoes 
{Yo Fred save me some} 
I walked up to these saimese twins 
And asked to have a threesome 
Told 'em two heads are better that one 
Plus I respect how y'all roll together as one 
Got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin 
Stood up like "Ay wait, where you goin" {bye!} 
Oh well 
Three strikes and I'm out 
I struck out and stood tied to the road {ouch} 
I ain't tryin' no more 
Fuck it- I'm chillin' 
Get a shot of yable {ahhh} 
Fell asleep on the ceiling
