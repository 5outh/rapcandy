Your mother, you fuckin faggot 
 
La da da, da da da, da da (repeated) 
 
Aiyo, this next song is dedicated to the memory of Erik Shrody 
Rest in peace, we aint forget about you, you fuckin homo 
We still remember 
 
There once was a man who liked to jump around (jump around) 
But he got too old to jump up and down (up and down) 
(so then what happened?) 
So he put the mic down and picked the guitar up (picked the guitar up) 
(and then he what?) 
Started singin the blues like there was no tommorrow (was no tommorrow) 
(come on) Left his boys in the House of Pain (the House of Pain) 
It was the wisest decision he ever made (ever made) 
But the dumbest thing that he could ever do (could ever do) 
Was try to buck a 380 on those that act shady 
Tell me now what you gonna do (now what you gonna do) 
 
[chorus] 
Cause I remember all those years 
How it was when you were here 
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young 
Yesterday was so long ago (long ago) 
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now 
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more 
 
I remember back when you had The Knack (had the knack) 
And I remember when you had your first heart attack (heart attack) 
I was right there laughin when I heard the news (heard the news) 
I just wish the cardiac would'a murdered you (would'a murdered you) 
(Damn) Maybe Ice-T's right, you are a bitch (you are a bitch) 
(maybe he's right) 
You come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich 
(leave when you're rich) 
But the dumbest thing that you could ever do (that you could ever do) 
Was try to buck a 380 on those that act shady 
Tell me now what you gonna do (now what you gonna do) 
 
[chorus] 
 
yo (yo) yo (yo) yo (yo) 
Remember back in '94, like right before Ms. Everlast was Whitey Ford 
Before his heart attack had him on life support 
When house of pain was out of fame like someone doused the flame 
And they became destined to never jump around again 
Or even further back, when i first had heard The Knack 
And you were down with Syndicate, I went to get your shit, man 
I was into it 
But then you went and took your style and switched the shit 
Now you sound rediculous you dickless piece of shit, 
How could you diss me, bitch? 
I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude, 
Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you 
Started rhymin, then you left the room 
and didn't say goodbye or nothin? 
Like you was mad that someone else was 
White and tried to rhyme or somethin 
I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin to steal your light or nothin 
But you're a homosexual, white rappin Irish {*Muslim*} 
Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a {*Muslim*} too 
Then I'd be confused as you, and I wouldn't know what to do 
What's up with you? 
I never fucked with you, why would you fuck with me? 
Knowin I could rap circles around you, what, are you as nuts as me? 
Plus I can sing better than you and I don't fuckin sing 
And probably play guitar better, and I ain't never touched a string 
But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you 
I'm what you used to be, shit you was me in '92 
So everytime I write a lyric, I'mma think of you 
And maybe that will help me know what it's like to sing the blues 
 
[chorus]x2 
 
You fuckin punk, pussy, you fuckin faggot, sissy, fuck 
And by the way, a 380's a fuckin sissy gun 
If you're gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin real gun 
You little bitch 
Next time say my fuckin name in a song 
Don't be subliminal about it 
You wanna fuckin diss me, diss me you fuckin faggot 
You fuckin punk, pussy, you fuckin little bitch, fuckin cunt
