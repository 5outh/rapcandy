[Intro]
Yo
I can't sing it
I feel like singin
I wanna fucking sing
Cos i'm happy
Yeh, i'm happy
HaHa
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out 

[Verse #1 Sung]
Some days i sit, staring out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes i think theres nothing to live for
I almost break down and cry 

Somtimes i think i'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am i here, am i just wasting my time 

But then i see my baby
Suddenly i'm not crazy
It all makes sense when i look into her eyes 

[Chorus]
Somtimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leaning on me
Cos sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she come back to me 

[Verse #2 Sung]
My baby girl [hailey laughs] keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, cos they don't understand me
They just dont see my real side 

I act like shit, dont phase me,
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive 

But then i see my baby
Suddenly i'm not crazy
It all makes sense when i look into her eyes 

[Chorus]

[Verse #3 Rapped]
Yeh and if i could sing, i'd keep singing this song to my daughter
If i could hit the notes, i'd blow something as long as my father
To show her how i feel about her, how proud i am that i got 'er
God, im a daddy, im so glad that her mum didn't [censored] (abort her)

Now you prob'ly get this picture from my public persona
That i'm a pistol-packing drug-addict who bags on his momma,
But i wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
Cos there's a lot of shit i keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' ma soul,
And just know that i grow colder the older i grow
This boulder on my shoulder that gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And i think my neck is breaking should i just give up
Or try to live up to these expectations now look,
I love my daughter more than life in itself,
But i got a wife who's determined to make my life living hell
But i handle it well, given the circumstances i'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that i've wasted are nothing to the tears that ive tasted
So here's what im facin: 3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, i've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people' backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, i shoulda seen it comin, why'd i stick my penis uppin
Woulda ripped the pre-nup if i'd seen what she was fuckin
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe the only lady that i adore, haley
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted
Its like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted 

[Chorus]

[Outro - Spoken]
Woow!
I told you, i can't sing.
Oh well, i tried
Haley, remember when i said
If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there
Well guess what, daddy's here.
And i ain't goin nowhere baby
I love you (kiss)
