My life is trapped in these lines,
Thats why im packin these nines,
I got a rap i aint diein',
Thats in the back of my mind,
Got a strap made of iron,
Cant relax on this grind,
Bendin over backwards for these slackers
Til im snappin my spine,
Natural high...i gotta focus,
On these bogus pochers, 
Lookin over my shoulder, 
Proof get it poppin like show'd a hold up,
