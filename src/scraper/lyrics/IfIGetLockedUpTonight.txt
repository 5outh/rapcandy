[Dr. Dre] 
Check Check, 1,2 , 1,2 1,2(it's rolling) 
Yea yea yea Dr. Dre up in here Y'all know what this is. 
Its what y'all been waiting for Funk Master Flex, Big Kap, 
Def Jam Records giving it to you baby. 
Yo Eminem show these mother fuckers what time it is baby 
 
[Eminem] 
I used to be a lonely man, only mad, until I got a million dollars, shit 
Now if i only had some fucking hair I'd pull it, faster than a bullet 
Out of Tupac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it 
I'm trying to grow it back again, it was an accident 
I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam 
I hate the straight jacket it aint latching, and can't lock it 
So they stapled my hand to my pants pockets 
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it 
Before me, and just kept throwing they fucking selfs at it 
My head is aching, I'm dedicated to medication 
But this med is taking to long to bring me this sedadation? (Come on!) 
Anyway I got down with Dre (What up?) 
The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray 
Running up and down the street screaming, "Fuck the Police" 
When you still had your mother's fucking Nipple stuck in your teeth 
(Fucking baby) Became a role model after Colorado 
Now all they do is follow me around and holla Bravo! 
Hell yea I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public 
Suck my dick, bitch 
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but I won't 
Cause you'll probably wanna stand in his place 
So put a sock in it, with your fake-ass Tupac image 
You faggots ain't tough, you just get drunk and become talkative 
(Wanna Fight?) I'm probably the akwardest alcoholic talking 
Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket 
So when you see me on your block stumbling, mumbling 
A bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does 
I ain't buzzed, I'mm juss high on life 
So why on earth would I need drugs, when I can fly on kites? 
Motherfuckers, Slim Shady 
 
Dr Dre: Dr Dre! 
Eminem: I'm drunk pass the tec 
 
[Eminem And Dr. Dre ] 
Cause if I get locked up tonite! 
Then I might not come home tonite! 
[Dre] Keep it moving! Off and on, Eminem is on 
Off and on, Dr. Dre is On 
Cause if I get locked up tonite! 
Then I might not come home tonite! 
[Dre] Keep it moving! Off and on, Eminem is on 
Off and on, Dr. Dre is On 
 
[Eminem] 
The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire 
I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron (AHH!) 
Psych I'm just joking, for christ sake 
Dont get so bent out of shape 
Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends 
Some people just don't get it, but I won't let it upset me 
Cause they don't know better 
They don't know what the fuck its like to be so fed up 
And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up 
My mind's got a mind of it's own, sometimes I can't find it at home 
It hides in the stove (Hello, where you at?) 
Shit, talk about your brain being baked 
My shit's still in the oven on 480 De-Grades 
Hailey Jade, daddy loves you baby, 
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter fuck you lady 
You critics wanna criticize but couldnt visualize 
Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes 
The neighborhood that I grew up in you could die for nothing 
And Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit 
I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth 
And shove his head in the fan blade 
Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say 
Or change cause of the age range in my fan base 
Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit 
Quit fucking buying it, I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit 
Hip Hop is universal now, it's all commercial now 
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now 
But now the Withe kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it 
But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night get silent 
Either that or booed, thats why I keep an attitude 
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon 
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it let me see a judge 
I'll confess to every murder I committed since 3 years old
