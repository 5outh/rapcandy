Steve: Hey, Em, what's up? 
Eminem: Steve Berman. What's goin' on, man, how you doin? Good to see you again. What's up? 
Steve: Em, could you come here and have a seat, please? 
Eminem: Umm, yeah, what's... 
Steve: Vannessa, shut the door. 
Secretary: Okay. 
Eminem: So what's up? How's orders looking for the first week? 
Steve: It would be better if you gave me nothing at all. 
Eminem: Wh- 
Steve: This album is less than nothing. I can't sell this fucking record. 
Eminem: Wha- 
Steve: Do you know what's happening to me out there? 
Eminem: Wh-wha-what's the problem? 
Steve: Violent Ground told me to go fuck myself! 
Eminem: Who's Violent...? 
Steve: Tower Records told me to shove this record up my ass! Do you know what it feels like to be told to have a record shoved up your ass? 
Eminem: But, I- 
Steve: I'm gonna lose my fuckin' job over this. You know why Dre's record was so successful? He's rappin' about big-screen tv's, blunts, 40's and bitches. You're rappin' about homosexuals and Vicadin. 
Eminem: I mean- 
Steve: I can't sell this shit! 
Eminem: What- 
Steve: Either change the record or it's not coming out! 
Eminem: What, I- 
Steve: Now get the fuck out of my office! 
Eminem: What am I supposed- 
Steve: NOW! 
Eminem: Alright man, whatever.
