Teats and Thurston Howell, and yelling Wordsworth 
My mother smoked crack I had a premature birth 
I'm just a nerve purse with badly disturbed nerves 
You wanna be the one to step up and get served first 
99% of aliens prefer Earth 
Come here to rule the planet, storm on your turf 
I hid a secret message inside of a word search 
With smeared letters, runnin together and blurs spurts 
Hang with male shovenest pigs and perverts 
I point water pistols at women and squirt shirts 
Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerbers 
My first words were bleep bleep and curse curse 
Never had shit and I still don't deserve dirt 
My breath still stinks, and I'm on my third cert 
Digging out my stitches, and hollering nurse nurse! 
You said this shot would numb me this shit just hurts worse!
