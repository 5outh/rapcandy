Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what? 
Outz in the area tearing things up 
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what? 
Outz in the area tearing things up (Sing it with me!) 
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what? 
Outz in the area tearing things up 
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?

[Az-Izz] 
Yo, I'm finally convinced my kindness and innocence 
Is a crime in a sense, climbing a fence 
Diagonally bent, dying in agony in a magically event 
Outz in a fear of family presents 
Capped in clak smoke, pack toast in a black coat 
To roast motherfuckers, over lactose 
Stay skeed off laced weed 
I take cheese, and page trees in the Bricks 
Rolling box of Tracies 
 
[Pace Won] 
Call a go-go dancer 
Get up in that ass and wreck shop like colon cancer 
Hit it from the back, bitch can't hold her pants up 
Once for my cock, twice for my block, 
I got it locked like handcuffs 
Pacer got a razor, get you and your man cut 
Swing a blow you can't duck 
Throw up your hands, what? 
Nobody on earth could see Pacer 
I get your shit then peel off like Speed Racer

[Slang Ton] 
I hit you bastards raps fast as Janet Jackson's coochie 
Your raps is half mastered, mad average, wack bologna 
And if you ever wanna get a deal 
You should either OD off skill pills 
Or steal my reel-to-reel 
Most of y'all emcees ain't tight as y'all should be when 
I'm tighter than the jeans that show hoochie chicks' coochie prints 
Outsidaz, we hot as Hell's flames is 
And I'm Slang-iz, my tapes get pumped like twelve gauges 
 
[Eminem] 
I'm so weeded (How weeded are you?) 
I'm so weeded I can freestyle for sixteen bars (Ha ha ha) 
Right off the top, then go back to the top 
And then repeat it (Ha) 
Write it down on the paper 
And still be able to read it (Sorry) 
I can't read, but I still write to my pen pals (Uh, uh, dear) 
I can't fly, but I still float on cement clouds (Whee!) 
I can't see cause my eyes already been gouged out 
I been down with the Outz for ten thou-sand years 
([Pace Won] So dunn, here?) 
Some weird kids with piercings in more than one ear 
Lauryn, huh? Hill? 
([Pace won] There's more than one? IIIllll) 
What? You want me to stop? Here?

[Young Zee] 
Yea 
Your girl could suck my dick chewing Big Red 
Till she choke and scrape her wisdom tooth on my dick head 
Puff a tray bag, Outz never pay cabs 
Bust a A-rab, front on taking us up eighth Ave 
Yea, we all of the a volumes 
What be the outcome? 
We selling twenty million albums 
Ay your record, ain't nobody buy that 
You fell off, and had to take your five mic 
And push a Withe Ac, with a bike rack 
 
[Axe] 
It's the A, the X, the E 
Why pay for ass, if I can sex for free? 
F' with we, what you expect to see 
Death's your destiny, when it's my time for rest in peace 
Bet they find my pistol next to me 
My dick is giving ecstasy 
Shit I say, spread like leprosy 
I'm on a quest to be, the best emcee 
Living recklessly, cock the weaponry 
Lay you on your back like Lei Wulong from Tekken 3 
Yo follow, never question me
