[Eminem] 
Hi! 
Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face 
Came in the place blowed, and sprayed Puffy with Mase 
I laced the weed with insect repellant, better check the smelly 
Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling 
with a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple 
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple (hurry up!) 
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I was sure 
that my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her 
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months 
and said, "I'm ready now bitch - ain't you feelin these kicks cunt?" 
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell 
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell 
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphillis germs 
and I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns 
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach 
and vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it (yuck!) 
(Yuck!)  Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet 
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til you numb it 
And all that gibberish you was spittin, you need to kill it 
Cause your style is like dyin in my sleep, I don't feel it 
 
Chorus: Eminem 
 
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin 
is fuckin crazy -- you hear me?  Ha? 
Is fuckin crazy -- hello, hi! 
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin 
is fuckin crazy -- do you hear me? 
Is fuckin crazy 
 
[Eminem] 
I'm ice grillin you, starin you down with a gremlin grin 
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym 
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias 
to save me with in case I get chased by space aliens 
A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium 
than a maniac Saudi Arabian 
A highly combustible head, spazmatic 
strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed 
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition 
I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician 
High speed, IV full of thai weed 
Lookin Chinese, with my knees stuck together like siamese 
twins, joined at the groin like lesbians 
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins 
I hope God forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends 
on if I keep on killin my girlfriends 
 
Chorus: Eminem 
 
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin 
is fuckin crazy -- you hear me?  Ha? 
Is fuckin crazy -- listen!! 
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin 
is fuckin crazy -- you hear me? 
Is fuckin crazy

Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust 
and got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed 
(Shucks!)  I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say 
I call in to work, cause all I do is frolic and play 
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day 
of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH) 
Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin 
Medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine 
Scratched my balls til I shredded skin 
"Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been" 
"It's probably AIDS!"  Forget it then 
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows 
that don't even make sense, like dykes usin dildos 
So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats 
and pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus 
Somethin somethin somethin, somethin I get weeded 
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it 
Damn!
