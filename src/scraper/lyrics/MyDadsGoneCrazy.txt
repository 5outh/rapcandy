Hello boys and girls

Do you have a daddy?

Eminem:
I'm goin to hell, who's comin' with me?

Hailie:
Somebody, please help him!
*giggle*
i think my dad gone crazy!

Verse #1:
There's no mountain i can't climb
There's no tower too high,
No plane that i can't learn how to fly
What do i gotta do to get through to you, destroy you
There ain't nothing i can't take this chainsaw to
*Hailey Makes Chainsaw Sound*
Fuckin' brain's brawn, and brass balls
I cut 'em off, i got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autograph,
Sunglasses with elton john's name, on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, i been lying my ass off
All this time, me and dre been fucking with hats off

Dr Dre:
Suck it marshall

Eminem:
Tell laura and her husband to back off
Before i push this motherfucking button and blast off
And launch one of these russians, and that's all
*Hailie Makes Explosion Sound*
Blow every fucking thing, except afghanistan on the map, off
We wanna stop, we wanna knock the crap off
*Knocking*
Haley, tell 'em baby

Haley:
My dad's lost it

Chorus:
Eminem:
There's really nothin' else to say ha, i can't explain it

Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!

Eminem:
A little help from hailie jade would, should tell them maybe

Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!

Eminem:
Theres nothing you could do to save it, could ever change me

Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!

Eminem:
There's noone on earth that can save me, not even halie

Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!

Verse 2:
It's like my mother always told me
*Eminem Impersinates His Mom*
Rnrnrnrnrnrrrr, n codeine n goddamit, you little motherfucker
If you aint got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
Er..
Fuck that shit, bitch, eat a motherfuckin' dick
Chew on a prick, and lick a million motherfuckin' cocks for second
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring in my nose
Then quit bringin my flos, quit giving me my ammo
Can't you see why i'm so mean? if y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my ammo
I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man i don't know no more
Am i the only fuckin one who's normal any more?

Hailey:
Dad

Chorus

Verse #3:
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
And at the same time, make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
So what you're seeing is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinterpret it at first,
Cuz when i speak, it's tongue in cheek
I'd gank my fuckin teeth before id ever bite my tongue
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as vanilla ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit, every time i sung
Like r kelly as soon as "bump n' grind" comes on
More pain inside o' my brain, in the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane
Aimed at the world trade, standin' on ronny's grave,
Screaming at this guy, the clouds gather as clyde mathers and bonnie jade
And nash briddy musta just stop it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
Nine millimeter, heater's desk, and two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, i wouldn't let hailie listen to me neither

Chorus

Outro:
Eminem:
Crazy

Hailie:
*laughs*
You're funny daddy!
