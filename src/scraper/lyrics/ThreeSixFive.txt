(Chorus) 
Skam: 
Yo I'm tryin to be the man of the day 
Three six five a year 
See the bullshit you sayin, Skam ain't tryin to hear (Fuck that!) 
Bustin lyrics in the air 
Keepin some up in the chamber 
 
Eminem: 
Yo Skam, what the fuck you doin? 
 
Skam: 
Man, I'm releasin anger 
 
Eminem : 
I'm tryin to be the illest of the day 
Three six five a year 
See that bullshit you sayin, Shady ain't tryin to hear 
Spittin lyrics in your ear 
Keepin some up in the chamber 
 
Skam: 
Aiyyo Shady what the fuck you doin? 
 
Shady: 
I'm releasin anger 
 
(Verse 1) 
Skam: 
Man I'm tired of bein tired, everytime I wake up 
Tired of these fake ducks, tired of bein late for the bus 
Tired of all be blendin, and endin up datin sluts 
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the fuck up! 
To the pity ass rappers, that ain't shit with out make-up, wake up 
Gold diggin bitches, the buck stops here 
The road to riches is closed for repair 
So if the shoe ain't fittin, girl leave that shit alone 
You aint Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone? 
I rip your tissue out your ear 
Spittin like I don't care 
My hair look like I ain't come it, shit a damn near year 
So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up 
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump 
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit 
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit 
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down 
They need to slow down, and take a look who the hoe now 
At every industry party, gettin so damn drunk 
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked 
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck 
Tryin to roll up on Miami, leavin with a broke neck 
Oh shit, leathal lyric equal land mind 
I be stackin up Withe rappers like im throwin gas signs 
And I'm, buck wild exposin the plain truth 
You couldn't mess with me, fuckin shit up in the same room 
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar 
For this bad car, that go along with the breath 
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft 
Cause in Miami, the baby jammin like three up in the chamber 
(Yo Skam what the fuck you doin?) 
 
(Chorus) 
 
Verse 2 
Eminem:
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change 
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name 
Became late to the last show with a different dane 
Brain ate from the last ode that I snifed the cane 
Yo know your spaced the fuck out like George Lucas 
When your pukus, turnin to yellow with orange mukus 
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers 
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English 
Freak genuis, too extreme for the weak and squeemish 
Burn you alive till you screamin to be extinquished 
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence 
Start a fire and block the hydrants 
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than 
So when Slim gets this M-16 burstin 
You gettin spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin 
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version 
Stoppin your short life when you still a teen virgin 
Unless you get a kidney speciman from a spleen surgeon 
In the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery 
To try to stop the blood from your rushin sternly eternally 
I'll take it back before we do each others name 
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame 
I'll take it further back than that 
Back to lovers lane, to the night you were started 
Cock block your fathers game 
I'll plead the fifth like my drawers were muzzled 
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle 
And when I'm down with ten seconds left, then to hope out 
I'ma throw a head-but so hard, I'll knock us both out 
 
(Chorus)
